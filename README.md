## Summary

D3Batt Scripts for data validation, processing, machine learning and early prediction

# Installation

Clone the repo via git and use pip (or `python setup.py develop`) for an editable install:

```bash
git clone git@github.awsinternal.tri.global:materials/BEEP-EP.git
cd BEEP-EP
pip install -e .
```

# Testing
You can use nose or pytests for running unittests (use `pip install nose` to install nose if not installed)

```bash
nosetests beep_ep
```

Note that the editable install (as prescribed above), is necessary
for nosetests.

# Using scripts

The standard installation procedure above should install and link console scripts
with currently available BEEP functionality.  Each beep script takes a JSON string
as input in order to provide flexibility and more facile automation.  They are documented
below:

### rename
The `rename` script takes no input, and operates by assuming the BEEP_EP_ROOT (default `/`)
has subdirectories `/data-share/raw_cycler_files` and `data-share/renamed_cycler_files/FastCharge`.

The script moves files from the `/data-share/raw_cycler_files` directory, parses the metadata,
and renames them according to a combination of protocol, channel number, and date, placing them in
`/data-share/renamed_cycler_files`.

The script output is a json string that contains the following fields:

* `fid` - The file id used internally for renaming
* `filename` - full paths for raw cycler filenames
* `strname` - the string name associated with the file (i. e. scrubbed of `csv`)
* `file_list` - full paths for the new, renamed, cycler files
* `protocol` - the cycling protocol corresponding to each file
* `channel_no` - the channel number corresponding to each file
* `date` - the date corresponding to each file

Example:
```bash
$ rename
```
```json
{
    "mode": "run",
    "fid": [0, 
            1, 
            2],
    "strname": ["2017-05-09_test-TC-contact", 
                "2017-08-14_8C-5per_3_47C", 
                "2017-12-04_4_65C-69per_6C"],
    "file_list": ["/data-share/renamed_cycler_files/FastCharge/FastCharge_0_CH33.csv", 
                  "/data-share/renamed_cycler_files/FastCharge/FastCharge_1_CH44.csv", 
                  "/data-share/renamed_cycler_files/FastCharge/FastCharge_2_CH29.csv"],
    "protocol": [null, 
               "8C(5%)-3.47C", 
               "4.65C(69%)-6C"],
    "date": ["2017-05-09", 
             "2017-08-14", 
             "2017-12-04"],
    "channel_no": ["CH33", 
                   "CH44", 
                   "CH29"],
    "filename": ["/data-share/raw_cycler_files/2017-05-09_test-TC-contact_CH33.csv", 
                 "/data-share/raw_cycler_files/2017-08-14_8C-5per_3_47C_CH44.csv", 
                 "/data-share/raw_cycler_files/2017-12-04_4_65C-69per_6C_CH29.csv"]
}
```

### validate_csvs
The validation script, `validate_csvs`, runs the validation procedure contained
in beep_ep.validate_csvs on renamed files according to the output of `rename` above.
It also updates a general json validation record in `/data-share/validation/validation.json`.

The input json must contain the following fields

* `file_list` - the list of filenames to be validated
* `mode` - mode for events i.e. 'test' or 'run'
* `run_list` - list of run_ids for each of the files, used by the database for linking data

The output json will have the following fields:

* `validity` - a list of validation results, e. g. `["valid", "valid", "invalid"]`
* `file_list` - a list of full path filenames which have been processed

Example:
```bash
$ validate csvs '{
    "mode": "run",
    "run_list": [1, 20, 34],
    "strname": ["2017-05-09_test-TC-contact", 
                "2017-08-14_8C-5per_3_47C", 
                "2017-12-04_4_65C-69per_6C"],
    "file_list": ["/data-share/renamed_cycler_files/FastCharge/FastCharge_0_CH33.csv", 
                  "/data-share/renamed_cycler_files/FastCharge/FastCharge_1_CH44.csv", 
                  "/data-share/renamed_cycler_files/FastCharge/FastCharge_2_CH29.csv"],
    "protocol": [null, 
               "8C(5%)-3.47C", 
               "4.65C(69%)-6C"],
    "date": ["2017-05-09", 
             "2017-08-14", 
             "2017-12-04"],
    "channel_no": ["CH33", 
                   "CH44", 
                   "CH29"],
    "filename": ["/data-share/raw_cycler_files/2017-05-09_test-TC-contact_CH33.csv", 
                 "/data-share/raw_cycler_files/2017-08-14_8C-5per_3_47C_CH44.csv", 
                 "/data-share/raw_cycler_files/2017-12-04_4_65C-69per_6C_CH29.csv"]
}'
```
```json
{"validity": ["invalid",
              "invalid",
              "valid"],
 "file_list": ["/data-share/renamed_cycler_files/FastCharge/FastCharge_0_CH33.csv", 
               "/data-share/renamed_cycler_files/FastCharge/FastCharge_1_CH44.csv", 
               "/data-share/renamed_cycler_files/FastCharge/FastCharge_2_CH29.csv"],
}
```

### structure_data

The `structure_data` script will run the data structuring on specified filenames corresponding
to validated raw cycler files.  It places the structured datafiles in `/data-share/structure`.

The input json must contain the following fields:
* `file_list` - a list of full path filenames which have been processed
* `validity` - a list of boolean validation results, e. g. `[True, True, False]`
* `mode` - mode for events i.e. 'test' or 'run'
* `run_list` - list of run_ids for each of the files, used by the database for linking data

The output json contains the following fields:

* `invalid_file_list` - a list of invalid files according to the validity
* `file_list` - a list of files which have been structured into processed_cycler_runs

Example:
```bash
$ structure_data '{
    "mode": "run",
    "run_list": [1, 20, 34],
    "validity": ["invalid", "invalid", "valid"], 
    "file_list": ["/data-share/renamed_cycler_files/FastCharge/FastCharge_0_CH33.csv", 
                  "/data-share/renamed_cycler_files/FastCharge/FastCharge_1_CH44.csv", 
                  "/data-share/renamed_cycler_files/FastCharge/FastCharge_2_CH29.csv"]}'
```
```json
{
  "invalid_file_list": ["/data-share/renamed_cycler_files/FastCharge/FastCharge_0_CH33.csv", 
                       "/data-share/renamed_cycler_files/FastCharge/FastCharge_1_CH44.csv"], 
  "file_list": ["/data-share/structure/FastCharge_2_CH29_structure.json"],
}
```

### generate_features
The `generate_features` script will generate features according to the methods
contained in beep_ep.generate_features.  It places output files corresponding to 
features in `/data-share/features/`.

The input json must contain the following fields

* `file_list` - a list of processed cycler runs for which to generate features
* `mode` - mode for events i.e. 'test' or 'run'
* `run_list` - list of run_ids for each of the files, used by the database for linking data

The output json file will contain the following:

* `file_list` - a list of filenames corresponding to the locations of the features

Example:
```bash
$ generate_features '{
    "mode": "run",
    "run_list": [1, 20, 34],
    "invalid_file_list": ["/data-share/renamed_cycler_files/FastCharge/FastCharge_0_CH33.csv", 
                          "/data-share/renamed_cycler_files/FastCharge/FastCharge_1_CH44.csv"], 
    "file_list": ["/data-share/structure/FastCharge_2_CH29_structure.json"]
}'
```
```json
{
  "file_list": ["/data-share/features/FastCharge_2_CH29_full_model_features.json"]}
```

### run_model
The `run_model` script will generate a model and create predictions
based on the features previously generated by the generate_features.
It stores its outputs in `/data-share/predictions/`

The input json must contain the following fields
* `file_list` - list of files corresponding to model features
* `mode` - mode for events i.e. 'test' or 'run'
* `run_list` - list of run_ids for each of the files, used by the database for linking data

The output json will contain the following fields
* `file_list` - list of files corresponding to model predictions

Example:
```bash
$ run_model '{
    "mode": "run",
    "run_list": [34],
    "file_list": ["/data-share/features/FastCharge_2_CH29_full_model_features.json"]
}'
```
```json
{
  "file_list": ["/data-share/predictions/FastCharge_2_CH29_full_model_predictions.json"],
}
```
