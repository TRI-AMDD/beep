"""
Features for predicting cycling characteristics from early cycles.

Typically these features are formed by looking at two or more early cycles,
assessing the differences between features of these cycles, then relating
that to the degradation characteristics of the battery. These features
can then be used with any cycler file with few numbers of cycles to predict
the total number of cycles before reaching certain degradation thresholds.
